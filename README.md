# General Substrate Theory (GST)

General Substrate Theory (GST) is a foundational physics framework in which all known physical behavior ‚Äî including mass, motion, inertia, gravity, time, quantization, and collapse ‚Äî emerges from a single causal principle: a conserved coherence substrate that reconfigures structure at a finite causal rate.

This repository contains the flagship paper, supplements, diagrams, and related resources that define GST and demonstrate its derivation of Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD), collapse thresholds, and inertial structure.

## üìú Core Law

At the heart of GST is one structural axiom:

> The substrate must fulfill structural change requests within its causal re-locking capacity.

From this law follow all known physical behaviors as different substrate response regimes:
- Newtonian mechanics ‚Üí smooth re-lock
- Relativity ‚Üí pacing delay
- Quantum phenomena ‚Üí tick-limited reconfiguration
- Collapse ‚Üí pacing failure and scalar offload

## üß† What GST Explains

GST reframes all known physics as emergent from substrate behavior:

| Phenomenon | GST Interpretation |
|------------|---------------------|
| Mass       | Saturated phase coherence |
| Inertia    | Resistance to rapid re-locking |
| Gravity    | Tension gradient from coherence denial |
| Time       | Scalar pacing interval between re-locks |
| Quantization | Tick-limited coherence updates |
| Collapse   | Structural ask exceeds substrate capacity |

## üî¨ Testable Predictions

GST makes falsifiable predictions not present in standard models:

- Geometry-dependent inertial drag
- Scalar precursor emissions prior to collapse
- Quantized offload steps in coherence failure
- Coherence memory in post-collapse substrate zones
- Upper frequency limit enforced by tick saturation

See Appendix D in the supplement for full details.
